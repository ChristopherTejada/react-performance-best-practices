# React Performance Best Practices

Curated and structured collection of high-impact React and Next.js
performance best practices, based on guidelines from Vercel Engineering.

## Objective
Study, classify and apply real-world performance rules used in
production-grade React applications.

## Structure
- **Critical**: Rules with direct impact on performance, UX and TTFB
- **High**: High-impact optimizations depending on application scale
- **Medium**: Advanced patterns and micro-optimizations

## Topics Covered
- Re-render optimization
- Server-side caching and data fetching
- Bundle size and loading strategies
- Rendering performance and hydration
- JavaScript performance patterns

## Approach
Each rule is analyzed, prioritized by impact, and can be accompanied
by practical before/after examples and explanations.

## Credits
Original guidelines inspired by React and Next.js performance research
from Vercel Engineering.
