# React Performance Best Practices

A curated and structured collection of high-impact React and Next.js
performance best practices, based on real-world production guidelines
inspired by Vercel Engineering.

This repository focuses on identifying, understanding, and applying
performance patterns commonly used in production-grade frontend
applications.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to study and organize performance rules
that have a measurable impact on:
- Rendering performance
- Server-side efficiency
- Bundle size and loading strategies
- User experience and responsiveness

Rather than covering theoretical optimizations, this repository focuses
on practical, real-world issues frequently found in React and Next.js
codebases.

## Who this is for

- Frontend developers working with React or Next.js
- Developers looking to improve application performance
- Engineers reviewing or auditing frontend code
- Developers preparing for performance-focused technical interviews

## How to use this repository

- Use the **rules** section as a checklist when reviewing code
- Apply the guidelines when building new features
- Refer to the **examples** to understand common performance pitfalls
- Use the project as a learning and interview preparation resource
