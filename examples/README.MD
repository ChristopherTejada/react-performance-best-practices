# Performance Examples

This directory contains practical before/after examples illustrating
common React and Next.js performance issues and their optimized
solutions.

Each example focuses on a specific rule from the `rules/` section and
demonstrates how small changes can lead to meaningful performance
improvements.

## Structure

Each example is organized as follows:


## How to read the examples

- Start with the **before** file to understand the issue
- Compare it with the **after** version
- Focus on what changed and why it improves performance
- Consider how the same pattern could appear in real projects

## Purpose of the examples

The examples are intentionally minimal and focused.
They are not meant to be complete applications, but clear illustrations
of specific performance patterns and mistakes commonly found in
production codebases.
